# Solve the X frontend

This is the frontend part of my assigment for Solve the X.
I had to create a web app capable of consuming 4 different endpoints in a Rest API.
Since I had little to no experiencie working with VueJS, I've only being able to consume two endpoints: requesting a token authorization, and using this token in order to ask for all the data.
The web is a visualization of a database of quotes.
